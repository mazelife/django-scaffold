About django-scaffold
======================

A Reusable application providing a generic section/subsection hierarchy in Django.

subsections and you not only need to be able to manage that hierarchy, but 
also hang other content off of it.

* `django-treebeard <https://tabo.pe/projects/django-treebeard/>`_.
